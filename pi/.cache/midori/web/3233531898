 <b>June 2010:</b> I love <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt>:
 It's taken me a while but I've now taken the time to understand the
 principle of <em>dynamic library interposition</em> as described
 in
 <a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/lib_interposers.html">
 this Sun Developers article</a>,
 which works on Solaris and Linux, with a few small changes.
 To make the Sun Developer malloc_interposer example work on Linux, just
 do the following:
</ul>

<ol>

<li>
Edit the source code and add:

<pre>
#define __USE_GNU
</pre>
 
after including stdio.h.

<li>
Compile via:

<pre>
gcc -o malloc_interposer.so -shared -fPIC malloc_interposer.c -ldl
</pre>

<li>
Then carry on as the Sun Developer instructions say, ie.

<pre>
setenv LD_PRELOAD $cwd/malloc_interposer.so
</pre>

<li>
Run the application - every malloc() call will now print out
its size.

<li>
Afterwards, don't forget to:

<pre>
unsetenv LD_PRELOAD
</pre>

</ol>

 <p>I've used this to build an experimental library to implement
 a per-directory umask.. more details later.

 <li><b>December 2009:</b> long gap, been busy.
 Just watched Bryan Lunduke's excellent
 <a href="http://lunduke.com/?p=429">Why Desktop Linux Sucks</a>
 presentation, he makes a number of very sensible points, well done to him for
 making them.  I'm a long term Unix (Solaris and Linux) lover and M$ hater,
 and IMHO Linux both Rocks and Sucks (at different things)!
 His main underlying theme seems to be: after an initial period of
 experimentation, the Linux community needs to standardise on a single way
 of doing each thing, and then make it work in a rock solid way which
 doesn't break later under an upgrade.  I agree 100%!
 <p>
 For example, software should only need to be built and packaged ONCE for all
 Linux distros, past present and future.  But this requires a single packaging
 system (RPM or DEB, I know both, they're both fully functional, I don't care
 which is chosen) along with a standard set of package names, version numbers
 and library versions to hang dependencies on.  This would make it easy for
 companies to port software to Linux, making Linux a single market.  The
 dependency problem is as important as the packaging system, btw - noone seems
 to ever mention that!  A corollary of this may well be that each new release
 of each (Ubuntu, Fedora, Redhat or whatever) distro would probably have to
 include old versions of each library packaged in the repo, where any number
 of versions of one library must be installable separately (without trampling
 on any other version that is installed).  Backwards compatibility matters
 (albeit to some people more than others)!

<h2>
<a NAME="career"></a><a NAME="bg"></a>Career Summary</h2>

<ul class="bullet">
 <li>
 After obtaining a 2-1 Computer Science Degree from Imperial College
 in 1986, I worked at the
 <a target="_top" href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Dept of
 Computing, Imperial College, London</a>
 until September 1993,
 preparing and auto-marking computing exercises,
 evaluating teaching software and giving short lecture courses.
 </li>

 <li>From October 1993 until April 2000, I worked as a Unix Systems
Administrator at the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey,</a>
working (over the years) in various SysAdmin roles within the Department
of Electronic &amp; Electrical Engineering and then the Department of
Mathematics and Computing.  As well as many technical responsibilities,
from 1997-2000 I was responsible for preparing, justifying, planning
and spending an annual Computing Equipment budget of &pound;50,000,
and also had direct management responsibility for a small team.</td>
 </li>

 <li>In May 2000, I left the University of Surrey and accepted a job
 as a <b>Senior Systems Programmer</b> working in the
 <a target="_top" href="/csg/">Computing
 Support Group</a> back at the
 <a target="_top" href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Dept of Computing,
 Imperial College London.</a> I specialise in Solaris and Linux support,
 C and Perl programming, and the web.
 </li>

 <li>In October 2002, I was promoted to
 <b>Deputy Manager</b> of the Computing Support Group, adding some
 managerial responsibility to my systems programming role.
 </li>

 <li>At Christmas 2002, I was given one of two Departmental
 <b>Extra Mile</b> awards (and bonus:-)) in reward for my
 continuing efforts in the Department.
 </li>

 <li>From 1st September 2006, after a bruising and unpleasant restructuring
 process, I was demoted to being a mere <b>Linux Systems Programmer</b>.
 </li>

 <li>
 In 2007, I considered leaving Imperial, and in particular
 was offered (but turned down!) the offer of a Unix Systems Administrator job
 with Google, when they decided after 5 months of interviews that the job
 was in Dublin rather than London!  I applied again in 2008, but their plans
 changed so that fell through.
 </li>

 <li>
 In Nov 2008, I was very pleased to be appointed to a new senior
 technical role created especially for me: the first
 <b>CSG Technical Coordinator</b>.  I guess the Departmental Management
 do want to keep me after all; thanks to them for sorting this all out!
 </li>

 <li>
 In summer 2009, the Dept embarked on another reorganisation of CSG,
 and made three colleagues redundant, and started giving away our network
 to the central College computing support.  Makes me consider other
 opportunities once more..
 </li>

 <li>
 In Jan 2010, with the departure of yet another colleague,
 I am now the <b>CSG Systems Manager</b>, and am now in
 effective charge of CSG on the <em>last man standing</em> principle.
 </li>

</ul>

<h2>
Experience</h2>

<ul class="bullet">
 <li>I have more than twenty five years experience of the
<b>Unix</b> operating
system, originally on Solaris (2.1 to 8) but more recently on Linux
(primarily Ubuntu, but also on Debian, Redhat, SuSE and Mandrake).
I've also used SunOS, BSD and even MacOS X.

 <li>
I am a skilled C and Perl programmer,
with an interest in constructing Graphical User
Interfaces using <b>X-Windows,</b> especially with <b>Motif</b> and
<b>Perl/Tk</b>. I am completely familiar with Unix software development tools
(<b>make, subversion and git, yacc/bison, lex/flex, debuggers, profilers</b> etc).
I am also knowledgable about SQL and relational databases, having worked with
Oracle, Ingres, Sybase/Microsoft SQL server, MySQL and (most recently and extensively)
Postgres.

<li>
I know many other computing languages, eg. Java, C++, Prolog, Pascal,
Miranda etc to differing levels of competence and expertise.
Although (because?) I currently maintain an Tomcat-based system,
I haven't got very excited about Java!
Based on all my programming experience, I've recently started writing some
<a href="PSD/">Thoughts on Practical Software Development</a>.
</li>

<li>I also have over fifteen years <b>Unix Systems Administration</b>
experience, on Solaris, Linux, SunOS and BSD.  I have supported users;
performed OS installations (both by hand and using networked methods
including Solaris Jumpstart, RedHat Kickstart and our own locally
developed technique);
have a good understanding of journalling filesystems (Veritas, UFS, XFS),
software RAID (Solstice Disk Suite, Linux MD) and hardware RAID connected
via SCSI or fibre-channel; volume management (Veritas Volume Manager, SDS,
Linux LVM/EVMS).

<li>
I've installed and supported a wide variety of Unix application software;
Built hundreds of software packages - Redhat Linux RPMs, Ubuntu DEBs and Solaris PKGs;
Built a complete Solaris infrastructure from scratch;
Maintained Solaris security (patching; upgrading; hardening);
Troubleshooted Solaris systems;
Implemented two complete tape backup and recovery systems;
Been responsible for a variety of specialist servers - fileservers
(NFS and Samba), mail servers (Smail, Exim),
web servers (Apache, mod_perl and Tomcat),
backup servers, CPU servers etc.
 </li>

<li>Between 1994-2000, while at the University of Surrey, alongside colleagues
<a target="_top" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/profiles?s_id=289">Bevis
King</a> and
Mike Stonebank (now at Redhat), I set up the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/">Elec Eng web-server,
one of the first production web servers at Surrey</a>. 
I wrote most of the CGI programs on these Web servers - in particular,
the
<b>showstaff</b> program mentioned in the links above.
When I moved to the Maths and Computing Department (as it then was) I
also created the first Maths and Computing Department website, and then
split it into two after a major reorganisation.
Over this time,
I learned a lot about the Web, HTML and CGI programming, and have a lot
of experience linking Oracle and Postgres databases to the Web via CGI
scripts.
 </li>

 <li>I have been using Larry Wall's brilliant
<b>Perl</b> language for nearly twenty years,
and now do most of my programming in it.
In 1997, I developed and gave a short lecture course on Perl programming -
this was expanded and repeated several times,
most recently during early <font color="red">December 2012</font>
when I reran it (primarily) for the
benefit of DoC second year computing students.
<a href="perl2012/">Here's the supporting web pages</a>.
</li>

 <li>In 1999, I cowrote
an article on <b>Perl and Morphology</b> - using Perl to generate inflections
and derivations of English words -
which was published in the Spring 2000 issue (#17) of <a target="_top" href="http://tpj.com">the Perl Journal</a>.
This has now been republished in the O'Reilly book
<b>Games, Diversions and Perl Culture (Best of the Perl Journal volume 3)</b>.
</li>

 <li>In September 2000, I gave a presentation at
<b><a target="_top" href="http://yapc.org/Europe/">The European Yet Another Perl Conference</a></b>
on <b>Generating Abstract Art with Perl</b>.
Please feel free to read
<a target="_top" href="webprogs/mondrianpres.ps">my presentation in Postscript form</a>
or
<a target="_top" href="webprogs/mondrianpres.pdf">PDF form</a>.
The programs discussed in this talk (and some others)
<a target="_top" href="webprogs/">can be found here at my Web Programs Page.</a>
 </li>

 <li>During 2003 and early 2004, I and my colleague Matt Johnson
set up the new clustered
<b><a target="_top" href="http://www.sunsite.org.uk/">SunSITE Northern Europe</a></b>
web/ftp/rsync mirroring service (a cluster of two Sunfire 280R servers with 2.1TB of useful data), which gave me the opportunity to get to grips with
Veritas Clustering software and to use mod_perl in anger.
 </li>

 <li>
  I have also performed various consultancy roles, using my
  Solaris, Linux, Motif and Perl skills.  Most recently, I
  worked with a company in the music media field on a data
  munging project which delivered high quality results.  I
  can't say much more than this, as a Non-Disclosure Agreement
  was involved.
 </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="teaching"></a>Teaching Interests</h2>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>Between 1996-2000, while at the University of Surrey, I designed
and taught a 25-lecture second year course called
<b>Computing Technology</b> which was a practical
introduction to
<i>Operating Systems,
Computer Architecture,
C Programming and Networks.
</i>Along with the lecture
materials, I developed a series of support programs (including an
assembler and Motif-based emulator for a teaching computer architecture
called Kiss-2, which is also used by several other Computer Architecture
courses at the University of Surrey).
</li>

<li>
Each December, I give my <b>Perl</b> short course (6 lectures),
mainly for the benefit of Computing second year students.
I have run this course, or it's predecessors, every year since 1997.
<a href="perl2012/">Here's the supporting web pages for the most recent version</a>.
</li>

<li>
Each November since 2006, I also give a regular lecture to our first year
students covering many practical <b>Tips and Techniques</b> for using the
DoC computing systems -
<a href="tipsntechniques/">here are the supporting web pages</a>.
This might be subtitled <b>Beneath the GUI (where things get interesting).</b>
</li>

<li>
<b>June 2011</b>: I've just developed and given a brand new first
year lecture on <b>C Tools</b>, building a toolbox of useful tools, and
the craft skills to use them effectively, in order to make C
programming easier. 
 <a href="c-tools/">Here's the supporting web pages of the version</a> -
 it's now two lectures, enabling me to fit Yacc and Lex in!
</li>

<li>I have also run short courses on the <b>C Programming Language</b>,
<b>Motif,</b>
<b>Designing Web (HTML) Pages</b>, <b>Perl and it's use for CGI programming</b>.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="int"></a>Other Interests</h2>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>My non-computing interests include swimming, walking
(especially in mountains, lakes and other wild places!),
music, plants and gardens.
<li>
For instance, here's an <a href="helvellyn/">account of a recent
trip, with friends, to Helvellyn in the English Lake District in August 2007</a>.
<li>
In addition, I am a keen amateur geologist with interests in geology,
paleontology and natural history.
I'm a member of the <b>Geologists Association</b> and go regularly on
geological field trips with the GA, and also with a mixed group of friends.
I am especially interested in evolution and consciousness, and enjoy reading
works about evolutionary biology
by authors such as
<b>Stephen Jay Gould</b> (now sadly deceased),
<b>Richard Dawkins</b>
and
<b>John Maynard-Smith</b> (also sadly deceased).
I am also a Friend of the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a> and of the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/">Natural History Museum, London.</a>
Click <a href="liparoceras_cheltiense/">here</a> for some pictures of
an amazing large ammonite I found near Lyme Regis in March 2008.
</li>

<li>I am also particularly interested in science fiction, and have cowritten
(with my friend
<a target="_top" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/profiles?s_id=289">Bevis
King</a>) web guides to <b>Dr Who, Blakes 7, Star Trek: The Next Generation</b>
and <b>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.</b>  I also enjoy <b>Enterprise</b>,
<b>Star Trek: Voyager</b>and the wonderful British sci-fi comedy
<b>Red Dwarf,</b> but haven't got around to writing guides for
them (yet :-)).
Josh Wheedon's wonderful <b>Firefly</b> series, sadly cancelled, and
the spin off film <b>Serenity</b> are my latest sci-fi enthusiasms.
Check out the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/Entertainment/">Entertainment

<li>I also enjoy a bit of photography, but can't hack all that stuff
with filters and manual exposures etc.
Like most people these days, I now use a fully automatic
digital camera (a Canon PowerShot A400), following an earlier
Pentax Zoom 70 that died a sad death after a close encounter with
a leaking water bottle.
Here's

Here are some of my other personal pages/projects:

<ul class="bullet">
<li>My <a target="_top" href="http://csgsoft.doc.ic.ac.uk/datadec/">Datadec - ANSI C
Recursive Data Type Generator</a>.  Take a look at this useful tool, and
feel free to download it and use it yourself.
</li>

<li>Take a look at my
<a href="webprogs/">Web Programs page.</a>
</li>

<li>My automatic conversion of the
<a target="_top" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/Edupage/">Edupage
newsletter to HTML</a> ran from 1993-1999 before Edupage stopped doing
the newsletter.
A Perl script parsed an incoming Edupage newsletter
via email and produced the HTML version automatically, updating an index
page as well.
</li>

<li>My collection of
<a target="_top" href="paleo.html">paleontology/geology</a>
resources found on the Web..
</li>

<li>
For the last 15 years, my brother Roger and his wife Juliet have owned
Yearlstone vineyard in Devon.
I set up
<a target="_top" href="http://www.yearlstone.co.uk/">
the Yearlstone website</a>
for them in May 2005 - please take a look,
and plan to visit it sometime..
In 2006, they were filmed by the BBC for the series
<b>The Great British Summer</b>, which was shown
on BBC1 on Sunday evenings in November 2006.
 At the end of August 2007, their vineyard was featured on BBC1's
 Countryfile, with Lotte Duncan and famous wine drinker Oz Clarke
 sampling Yearlstone Fizz on the cafe terrace with it's amazing
 views over the lower Exe valley.
 I've just set up (March 2008)
 <a href="http://www.devonwineweek.co.uk/">www.devonwineweek.co.uk</a>
 for my brother Roger and his colleagues at other Devon vineyards who
 organise the Devon Wine Week each year.  Take a look at that - come
 and visit Devon that week!
